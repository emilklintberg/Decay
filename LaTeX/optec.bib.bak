	of analytic expressions, numerical approximation by divided differences,
	or manipulation of symbolic algebraic expressions by computer algebra

	gradient method has been successfully extended for solving unconstrained
	optimization problems and is competitive with conjugate gradient
	methods. In this paper, we establish the R-linear convergence of
	the BB method for any-dimensional strongly convex quadratics. One
	corollary of this result is that the BB method is also locally R-linear
	convergent for general objective functions, and hence the stepsize
	in the BB method will always be accepted by the non?monotone line
	search when the iterate is close to the solution.},

  title = {Modelling and control of rotational start-up phase of tethered aeroplanes
	for wind energy harvesting},
  school = {{K}.{U}.{L}euven},
  year = {2010},
  month = {June},
  abstract = {'Modelling and control of rotational start-up phase of tethered aeroplanes
	for wind
	
	energy harvesting' looks at a novel approach at harvesting wind power,
	other than
	
	with wind turbines, 'crosswind kite power'. An aeroplane, anchored
	to the ground,
	
	transmits power to a ground-based generator by periodically pulling
	out the tether.
	
	In particular, this thesis focuses on a rotational start-up strategy
	of this system. A
	
	rotational start-up involves accelerating the aeroplane by towing
	it around a central
	
	axle. The tether is progressively enrolled until injection into an
	energy generating
	
	orbit at high altitude.
	
	On one hand, this thesis develops an indoor test platform to allow
	demonstrating
	
	rotational start-up on a small scale in the future. The test platform
	entails a measurement
	
	system, using stereovision, to estimate the position and orientation
	of the
	
	aeroplane. A first experiment with a radio-controlled aeroplane equipped
	with LEDs
	
	for clear marker visibility, shows the possibility for accurate state
	estimation. Indoor
	
	usage of the test platform excludes unpredictable disturbances of
	the wind.
	
	On the other hand, this thesis develops mathematical models to describe
	the dynamics
	
	of the system. The models allow simulating the tethered aeroplane
	and to find periodic
	
	orbits that are optimal in certain criteria. Model predictive control
	is used to follow
	
	these trajectories in simulation. Robustness of the system with respect
	to sidewind
	
	disturbance was assessed.},

  year = {2011},
  abstract = {In this master thesis, Reversed Pumping for Tethered Airplanes in
	No-Wind Conditions,
	
	we search for control strategies for a novel method to harvest wind
	power.
	
	Generally, wind is stronger and more consistent at higher altitudes.
	To reach these
	
	more interesting regions to exploit the wind speed, traditional wind
	turbines, require
	
	increasingly large expensive constructions. In the tethered kite power
	setup proposed
	
	by Loyd, energy is produced by periodically unrolling and retracting
	the cable
	
	of a tethered airplane, which is connected to a base station through
	a winch. This is
	
	called a pumping cycle.
	
	The main goal of this thesis was to find periodic orbits in absence
	of wind for
	
	the kite setup of the K.U.Leuven OPTEC Kite Power group. This means
	the energy
	
	required to sustain flight should be supplied purely by the base station!
	The trajectories
	
	are then optimized with respect to total power consumption.
	
	For small tether lengths, the plane can be supplied with power by
	means of a
	
	rotating carousel, resulting in a passively stable orbit. For a cable
	length longer than
	
	9 [m], the orbit cannot be sustained any longer by the carousel alone,
	and the winch
	
	starts to take over. Parallel to this thesis a winching system was
	designed for the
	
	Kite Power test setup, so the tether length could be varied. By applying
	a periodic
	
	energy consuming scheme called reversed pumping, it was theorized
	the airplane
	
	could be kept in the air even without wind. The found trajectories
	support this idea.},

  abstract = {Results from simulation and optimisation are only successfully applicable
	in reality if the underlying model precisely reflects the behaviour
	of the regarded process. While it is possible to use parameter estimation
	methods directly if the predictions of a \emph{single} model shall
	be improved, model discrimination strategies have to be applied first
	if \emph{several} competing models are available.
	
	
	 This work deals with numerical aspects of solution strategies for
	model discrimination problems. The emphasis is set on an integrative
	presentation of both essential theory and issues of practical implementation.
	The success of the described methods is demonstrated in three real-world
	applications from biochemistry.
	
	
	 We treat dynamic processes which can be described by nonlinear implicitly
	defined regression models on the basis of semi-explicit differential-algebraic
	equations (DAEs) of index 1. A mathematical formulation of the model
	discrimination problem for this general class of models is given.
	
	
	 To validate and improve the predictions of a single model, parameter
	estimation strategies are applied leading to nonlinear constrained
	least squares problems (LSQ). For their solution we apply an efficient
	generalised Gauss-Newton-Method.
	
	
	 We formulate statistical tests basing on the results from parameter
	estimation which allow to identify unsuitable models out of a set
	of rival models. Central part of this work is the design of experiments
	which are most efficient for bringing about a decision with these
	tests. We introduce theoretical optimality criteria for such designs.
	A sequential procedure which allows to determine them in practice
	is described, where special attention is payed to adaptability to
	real-world dynamic DAE models. This approach leads to constrained
	nonlinear optimal control problems with a characteristic multiple-setpoint
	structure.
	
	
	 For the discretisation of the optimal control problem we follow a
	direct multiple shooting approach resulting in a highly structured
	nonlinear problem (NLP) which is solved by a structure exploiting
	SQP method. As the dimension of model discrimination problems can
	grow very large, it is examined how the efficiency of the SQP method
	can be increased by exploiting the intrinsic sparsity structure induced
	by the multiple-setpoint property.
	
	
	 Importance was attached to incorporate all introduced techniques
	in the context of established procedures of model finding.},

  abstract = {The complex-step derivative approximation and its application to numerical
	algorithms are presented. Improvements to the basic method are suggested
	that further increase its accuracy and
	
	 robustness and unveil the connection to algorithmic differentiation
	theory. A general procedure for the implementation of the
	
	 complex-step method is described in detail and a script is developed
	that automates its implementation. Automatic implementations of the
	
	 complex-step method for Fortran and C/C++ are presented and compared
	to existing algorithmic differentiation tools. The complex-step method
	is tested in two large multidisciplinary solvers and the
	
	 resulting sensitivities are compared to results given by finite differences.
	The resulting sensitivities are shown to be as accurate as the analyses.
	Accuracy, robustness, ease of implementation and maintainability
	make these complex-step
	
	 derivative approximation tools very attractive options for sensitivity
	analysis.},

  abstract = {In unmanned aerial vehicle operations as well as
	
	in aviation the airflow direction and speed plays a major
	
	role. The wind speed may limit the use of aircraft, and
	
	determines the direction of the takeoff and landing. In the
	
	case of small size UAVs (0.5 - 4 m wingspan, 0.5 - 10 kg
	
	takeoff weight) the strength and the direction of the wind is
	
	quite important, because the airspeed of the vehicle is in the
	
	same scale, and the turbulence can affect the flight path.
	
	The general methods of wind measurement cannot be
	
	applied onboard of the UAV. Although the ground
	
	measured wind data is sufficient for the takeoff, but it is
	
	irrelevant when the UAV is landing in a different place, e.g.
	
	on a far field. In that case, the wind speed and direction
	
	must be measured onboard the vehicle, before the landing
	
	maneuver. The aim of the research is the real time
	
	determination of the dominant wind data with the onboard
	
	sensors.

	Two perspectives can be followed: systems with a material type of

	and systems for which the variation of mass is of a nonlinear control
	volume type, mass trespassing a control surface. This is the case
	if, for some theoretical or practical reason, a partition into subsystems
	is considered. An important class of problems in which the extended
	Lagrange equations turn to be useful emerges from "hydromechanics,"
	whenever a finite number of generalized coordinates can be used,
	under the concept of the added mass tensor. A particular and interesting
	one is addressed in the present paper: the classical hydrodynamic
	impact of a rigid body against a liquid free surface.},

  abstract = {LIDAR systems are able to provide preview information of wind disturbances
	at various distances in front of wind turbines. This technology paves
	the way for new control concepts in wind energy such as feedforward
	control and model predictive control. This paper compares a nonlinear
	model predictive controller with a baseline controller, showing the
	advantages of using the wind predictions in the optimization problem
	to reduce wind turbine extreme and fatigue loads on tower and blades
	as well as to limit the pitch rates. The wind information is obtained
	by a detailed simulation of a LIDAR system. The controller design
	is evaluated and tested in a simulation environment with coherent
	gusts and a set of turbulent wind fields using a detailed aeroelastic
	model of the wind turbine over the full operation region. Results
	show promising load reduction up to 50% for extreme gusts and 30%
	for lifetime fatigue loads without negative impact on overall energy
	production. This controller can be considered as an upper bound for
	other LIDAR assisted controllers that are more suited for real time
	applications.},

	To address the first problem we discuss both a projection and a null-space

	constraints. Concerning the uncertainties, we discuss an approximate
	robust optimal control formulation based on Lyapunov differential
	equations. Here, the invariants and periodic boundary constraints
